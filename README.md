This project is a scheduling application where you can add custom events or request from application to suggest you some kind of events.

# Technologies

Python Flask framework, vanilla javascript, HTML and CSS are used to build this application.

I have used flask because this application needs very simple backend. Only think i need to serve my template and static files. 
Because of this reason, there is no need to use a batteries included framework like Django.

Since this application needs a simple backend, I haven't used any frontend 
framework like React or Angular. I have used vanilla js.

Finally, instead of CSS I have used bootstrap 5. It really boosts development
speed and ease a lot.
